# Character Sheet. App. (Semi-) Automatic.

## Synopsis

This project is a fork of [`derikb/character-sheet-app`](https://github.com/derikb/character-sheet-app), which is a responsive online/offline web app to act as a character sheet for tabletop roleplaying games (mostly D&amp;D 5e). This fork focuses on expanding the features of the original project and making the app friendlier to TTRPG newbs.

## Planned Features

I plan to add the following features (in no particular order):

* Automated sheet population (such as populating your Saving Throws area based on your class)
* Support for homebrew races/classes/items/etc. (by default, the app will only support SRD content from DnD 5e).
* Inclusion of derikb's manual controls. While automatic sheet population will be nice, sometimes you need to make manual adjustments beyond the vanilla settings.
* Support for more platforms. I like the idea of an app like this being a standalone thing on one's desktop or phone, or in a docker image, or embedded wherever else. This one's a big stretch goal, though, because I have NO idea what I'm doing there.
* More/better organization for new players to be able to navigate and read it easier
* Theme support?

## Motivation

I had a lot of the same motivations as derikb, with a few others. I thought maybe someone else would want these things too.

## Contributors

I'm happy to accept feature requests, bug reports, and pull requests via the github repository. There is an eslint config file for javascript style, which your IDE should pick up.

Conventional Changelog is installed for commit messages. Standard Version is used for releases, changelogs, etc.

## Miscellaneous Disclaimers

This project and everything about it is a work in-progress by an amateur dev and git user. This project is not my job, I don't have an unlimited amount of free time to work on it, and I'm not very good at programming. This project will have bugs. It will not be completed quickly. It may not ever be completed.

Stay tuned for updates to README.md and any other file I get my grubby hands on.
