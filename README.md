# Character Sheet. App. (Semi-) Automatic.

This project is a fork of [`derikb/character-sheet-app`](https://github.com/derikb/character-sheet-app), which is a responsive online/offline web app to act as a character sheet for tabletop roleplaying games (mostly D&amp;D 5e). This fork will focus on styling changes and automating field completion based on a user's selections.

## Synopsis

In-progress by an amateur dev and git user. Stay tuned for updates to README.md and all the important bits mentioned above.
